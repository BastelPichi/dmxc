# Tips
Some tips to keep in mind while using DMXC3.

- Default in Selections
  You can get the default Value (0-position) in a Color- or Position-Selector by double clicking. For color-selectors, you can double-right-click to go to black.
- Selecting Devices
  You can select Multiple Devices in the Stage View by Clicking, Holding and then Dragging you mouse, or by holding Ctrl.
  It's reccomended to never work with Fanning or Effects when selecting devices manually - instead use Device Groups. Every order you select the fixtures in is an temporary, unique group, and you'll only be able to easely edit Fannings/Effects by selecting your fixtures in the exact same order. Make your live easier and use Device Groups.
